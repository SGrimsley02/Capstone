Capstone Project

## Running the Application

We need to run a server to connect to the API. Navigate to remix-ui and run
`python -m http.server 5000`
Then, visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

Sprint 1 Note: Both Main and SleepMonitor are active branches with completed code, but not merged due to sizable changes coming to both.
